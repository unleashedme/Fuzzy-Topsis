# Fuzzy-Topsis
Goal : Using Triangular Fuzzy Numbers Make a multicriteria Decision Making System where criteria evaluations are subjectiove and uncertain.<br />
Steps:<br />
    1.Define the decision matrix: List the alternatives and criteria.<br />
    2.Normalize the fuzzy matrix: Normalize the fuzzy data to bring all values to a comparable scale.<br />
    3.Calculate the weighted normalized fuzzy matrix: Multiply the normalized matrix by the importance weights (expressed as fuzzy 
    numbers).<br />
    4. Determine the fuzzy positive ideal solution (FPIS) and fuzzy negative ideal solution(FNIS).<br />
    5.Calculate the distances : Measure the distance between each alternative and the FPIS and FNIS using a fuzzy 
    distance measure.<br />
    6.Calculate the closeness coefficient (CC)<br />
    7. Rank the alternatives: Rank the alternatives based on the closeness coefficient (higher is better).<br />
