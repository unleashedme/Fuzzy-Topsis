# Fuzzy-Topsis
Goal : Using Triangular Fuzzy Numbers Make a multicriteria Decision Making System where criteria evaluations are subjectiove and uncertain.
Steps:
    1.Define the decision matrix: List the alternatives and criteria.
    2.Normalize the fuzzy matrix: Normalize the fuzzy data to bring all values to a comparable scale.
    3.Calculate the weighted normalized fuzzy matrix: Multiply the normalized matrix by the importance weights (expressed as fuzzy 
    numbers).
    4. Determine the fuzzy positive ideal solution (FPIS) and fuzzy negative ideal solution(FNIS)
    5.Calculate the distances : Measure the distance between each alternative and the FPIS and FNIS using a fuzzy 
    distance measure.
    6.Calculate the closeness coefficient (CC)
    7. Rank the alternatives: Rank the alternatives based on the closeness coefficient (higher is better).
